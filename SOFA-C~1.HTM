This uses minimal moisture and gentle cleaning powders or foams.<br><br>Foam Cleaning: High-foam shampoo is applied and agitated, then removed using specialized machines.<br><br>Leather Treatment: Leather sofas receive pH-balanced cleaning followed by moisturizing agents to maintain flexibility and shine.<br><br>Step 4: Deodorizing and Sanitization<br><br>Antibacterial sprays and deodorants are applied to eliminate lingering smells and germs, leaving the sofa fresh and hygienic.<br><br>Step 5: Drying and Post-inspection<br><br>The sofa is dried using air movers or natural air, depending on the method used. A final inspection ensures all issues are resolved.<br><br>Health and Hygiene Benefits<br><br>Sofas may look clean but often harbor bacteria, mold spores, viruses, and allergens.
